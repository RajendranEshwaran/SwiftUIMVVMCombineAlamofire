# Yet Another App for Displaying Popular Movies and TVShows 
Example of using iOS 13 SwiftUI/Combine/Alamofire with an MVVM Flavor.

# Description
Simple application for showing top movies and tv shows using combine framework, Alamofire and swiftUI
# To Build and Run
* Requires XCode 13.0.1 and above.
* Have only tested on Simulator in iOS 13+.
* You may seen AlamoFire as an installed Switft Package Dependency. While XCode 13 seems to let you add Swift Packages it is still a mystery how to remove them. None of the source should be using Alamofire.

# Known Issues
* NOTE: I have ONLY TESTED THIS In the XCode 13.0 and Simulator.
* It works on iPhone just fine.
WARNING on iPAD:
